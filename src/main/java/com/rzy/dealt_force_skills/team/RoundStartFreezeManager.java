/**
 * Tracks the short "round just started" window during which a dealtmatch player cannot move,
 * attack, fire, or use active character skills, while still being free to buy items, use
 * consumables, wear armor, and switch fire modes. Backed by a client-synced
 * {@link ModEffects#ROUND_START_FREEZE} MobEffect rather than a server-only NBT timestamp,
 * because a real {@code ServerPlayer}'s position is client-authoritative: only a client-visible
 * signal lets {@code RoundStartFreezeInputHandler} actually stop the player from walking (see
 * that class for the input-cancelling side of this feature). Deliberately independent from the
 * "downed" persistent-state family (see {@code StingerStateManager#isDowned}) because that
 * family also blocks GUIs/item use, which this feature must not touch.
